            Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon
            Valley. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed
            College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974, and
            saved enough money for a pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism.

            Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school
            friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing
            his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after
            Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board,
            was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and
            Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
            <br><br>
            Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad
            audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s
            encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged
            to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.
